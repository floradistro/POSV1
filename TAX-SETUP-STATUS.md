# Store-Level Tax Setup Status

## ‚úÖ What's Working

### POS Frontend
1. **Tax Calculation Engine** - Fully implemented with compound tax support
2. **Tax Display** - Shows individual tax breakdown in cart
3. **Order Integration** - Tax metadata saved with each order
4. **Fallback Tax Rates** - Hardcoded rates for testing

### Current Tax Rates (Hardcoded for Testing)

#### Charlotte Locations (Monroe & Nations Ford)
- NC State Tax: 4.75%
- Mecklenburg County Tax: 2.5%
- Cannabis Excise Tax: 15% (compound)
- **Total: 23.96%**

#### Elizabethton
- TN State Tax: 7%
- Local Tax: 2.5%
- **Total: 9.5%**

#### Salisbury
- NC State Tax: 4.75%
- Rowan County Tax: 2%
- **Total: 6.75%**

#### Blowing Rock
- NC State Tax: 4.75%
- Watauga County Tax: 2.25%
- **Total: 7%**

## üîß WordPress Plugin Setup (Required)

The tax rates are currently hardcoded in the POS for testing. To enable dynamic tax configuration through WordPress:

### 1. Activate REST API Routes
```bash
# SSH into your WordPress server
cd /path/to/wordpress

# Deactivate and reactivate the plugin to re-register routes
wp plugin deactivate addify-multi-location-inventory --allow-root
wp plugin activate addify-multi-location-inventory --allow-root

# Flush rewrite rules
wp rewrite flush --allow-root
```

### 2. Verify REST API Routes
Visit: `https://api.floradistro.com/wp-json/`
Look for: `/wc/v3/addify_multi_inventory/location/{id}/tax-rates`

### 3. Configure Tax Rates in WordPress
1. Go to **WooCommerce > Multi Inventory > Locations**
2. Edit each location
3. Scroll to **Tax Configuration** section
4. Add your tax rates:
   - Click "Add Tax Rate"
   - Enter tax name, rate, and type
   - Check "Compound" for taxes that apply on top of other taxes

### 4. Update POS API Route
Once the WordPress endpoint is working, remove the fallback rates:

Edit `/src/app/api/tax-rates/[storeId]/route.ts`:
- Change `addify_headless_inventory` back to `addify_multi_inventory` if needed
- Remove the hardcoded test tax rates

## üìä Testing Tax Calculations

### Example: $100 Purchase at Charlotte
1. Subtotal: $100.00
2. NC State Tax (4.75%): $4.75
3. Mecklenburg Tax (2.5%): $2.50
4. Subtotal + Non-compound taxes: $107.25
5. Cannabis Tax (15% compound): $16.09
6. **Total: $123.34**

### Example: $100 Purchase at Elizabethton
1. Subtotal: $100.00
2. TN State Tax (7%): $7.00
3. Local Tax (2.5%): $2.50
4. **Total: $109.50**

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Tax Not Showing
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify you're logged into a store with configured rates
3. Clear browser cache

### Wrong Tax Calculation
1. Verify compound tax settings
2. Check rate values (8.5 not 0.085 for 8.5%)
3. Review tax order (non-compound first, then compound)

### API 404 Errors
1. Check WordPress plugin is active
2. Verify REST API is accessible
3. Check WooCommerce API credentials
4. Review WordPress error logs

## üìù Next Steps

1. **WordPress Admin**: Configure actual tax rates for each location
2. **Plugin Fix**: Ensure REST API routes are properly registered
3. **Remove Hardcoded Rates**: Once WordPress API works
4. **Test All Locations**: Verify each store's tax calculations
5. **Train Staff**: On how taxes are displayed and calculated
